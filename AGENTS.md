# SwimmerParty-Website AI Router

## PGS Router Block

<!-- PGS-ROUTER:BEGIN v1.1 -->

## Boundary

- PGS governs this `AGENTS.md` entry and governed Markdown under `docs/**`.
- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical project router; `CLAUDE.md` must be the exact
  relative symlink `AGENTS.md`.
- `.agents/skills/` is the canonical project skill root; `.claude/skills`
  must be the exact relative symlink `../.agents/skills`.
- Product artifacts outside `docs/**` are not governed docs unless this project explicitly opts them in.
- `README.md` is the human-facing introduction; read it only for positioning,
  public explanation, or README work.
- `docs/reference/execution/current-work.md` is the active-work index; read it
  when the task depends on current priorities or in-flight work.
- This project's adopted profile is `engineering-runtime`.
- Its selected agents routing file is `docs/governance/agents-routing/engineering-runtime-v1.1.md` under
  `docs/governance/agents-routing/`.

## Policy Discovery

All Markdown under `docs/policy/**/*.md`, including subdirectories and any
symlinked shared-rule files, belongs to the discoverable policy index. This is
not a command to load every policy at startup. Read the project-local baseline
and only the shared rules whose task surface actually matches.

## Skill Availability

An asset manifest or lock records desired state; it does not prove that an
optional skill is installed, host-discoverable, loaded, or invoked. Use a skill
only when its SKILL.md actually exists and can be read. Centrally managed
project links may need the portfolio control plane to materialize them after a
fresh clone; their absence must not hide or replace the portable policy rules.

## Documentation Tasks

When the task creates, edits, moves, deletes, or governs documentation, read
`docs/governance/boundary.md`, `docs/governance/ssot-v1.1.md`,
`docs/governance/doc-agent-rules.md`, `docs/governance/doc-types.md`, the
selected agents routing file, and the policy files that govern the changed
surface. Keep project AI development policy in `docs/policy/`.

## Three-Stage Delivery

<!-- PGS-DELIVERY:THREE-STAGE -->

1. **Edit locally.** Run relevant local checks with isolated data and mocks; do
   not start paid external validation during ordinary development.
2. **Verify, then push.** Pass the checks appropriate to the changed surface
   before pushing. Ordinary push/PR saves code; it must not start hosted Actions
   or Vercel preview/production deployments.
3. **Release explicitly.** A release request may continue through cloud acceptance
   and publication within the agreed budget. Check credentials, environment and
   candidate readiness first; failed or missing required evidence blocks release.
   Publish only the tested source/artifact. Reuse results only while source,
   dependencies, relevant environment and retained artifacts remain valid.

An explicitly requested preview/staging acceptance belongs to stage 3. An edit
or push request stops at stage 2. Do not relabel routine saves as release requests.
Repeated failures require a smaller reproducer, logs and a relevant fix or new
evidence before rerunning; do not loop whole suites or silently raise budgets.
Keep existing release/security gates and production runtime monitoring. These
rules govern engineering validation, not separately authorized creative production.


## Upstream Rule

Do not locally invent doc-gov core changes such as new document statuses,
frontmatter schema, lifecycle rules, shared agents-routing rules, or external
shared-rule placement contracts. Propose them in the Project Governance System
upstream repository first.

## Website Release Entry

Only after an explicit website release request and the relevant local gates:

1. Use a clean, committed candidate. Run required manual Actions acceptance for
   that exact commit, if the project requires it; failure blocks publication.
2. Confirm Vercel binding to `swimmerparty` (`pie-0f420159`); use
   `vercel link --project swimmerparty --scope pie-0f420159` if unbound.
3. Create a production-configured candidate with
   `vercel deploy --prod --skip-domain --yes --scope pie-0f420159`.
   This is paid release work; it must not run during ordinary edit/push.
4. Verify the returned deployment URL with the project's smoke checks, then
   `vercel promote <verified-deployment-url> --scope pie-0f420159`.
   Promote that artifact; do not rebuild, guess a URL, or promote after failure.

Existing package publishing or backend migration gates remain separate.
