# SwimmerParty-Website AI Router

## PGS Router Block

<!-- PGS-ROUTER:BEGIN v1.1 -->

## Boundary

- PGS governs this `AGENTS.md` entry and governed Markdown under `docs/**`.
- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical project router; `CLAUDE.md` must be the exact
  relative symlink `AGENTS.md`.
- `.agents/skills/` is the canonical project skill root; `.claude/skills`
  must be the exact relative symlink `../.agents/skills`.
- Product artifacts outside `docs/**` are not governed docs unless this project explicitly opts them in.
- `README.md` is the human-facing introduction; read it only for positioning,
  public explanation, or README work.
- `docs/reference/execution/current-work.md` is the active-work index; read it
  when the task depends on current priorities or in-flight work.
- This project's adopted profile is `engineering-runtime`.
- Its selected agents routing file is `docs/governance/agents-routing/engineering-runtime-v1.1.md` under
  `docs/governance/agents-routing/`.

## Policy Discovery

All Markdown under `docs/policy/**/*.md`, including subdirectories and any
symlinked shared-rule files, belongs to the discoverable policy index. This is
not a command to load every policy at startup. Read the project-local baseline
and only the shared rules whose task surface actually matches.

## Skill Availability

An asset manifest or lock records desired state; it does not prove that an
optional skill is installed, host-discoverable, loaded, or invoked. Use a skill
only when its SKILL.md actually exists and can be read. Centrally managed
project links may need the portfolio control plane to materialize them after a
fresh clone; their absence must not hide or replace the portable policy rules.

## Documentation Tasks

When the task creates, edits, moves, deletes, or governs documentation, read
`docs/governance/boundary.md`, `docs/governance/ssot-v1.1.md`,
`docs/governance/doc-agent-rules.md`, `docs/governance/doc-types.md`, the
selected agents routing file, and the policy files that govern the changed
surface. Keep project AI development policy in `docs/policy/`.

<!-- PGS-ROUTER:END -->

## Upstream Rule

Do not locally invent doc-gov core changes such as new document statuses,
frontmatter schema, lifecycle rules, shared agents-routing rules, or external
shared-rule placement contracts. Propose them in the Project Governance System
upstream repository first.
